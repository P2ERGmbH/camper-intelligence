# Main Project Context: Camper Intelligence Next.js Project with Docker Setiup

## General Instructions
- **Never** replace code with comments like `// TODO: implement this` or `# TODO: implement this` or `// ... (do something) ` or `// ... (rest of the function)`.
- **Never** use any as a type unless absolutely necessary. If so make sure to include a eslint comment to disable the rule for that line.
- **Always** Run `npm run lint` after file changes and fix resulting errors. If "> eslint" is not followed by errors, you are good to go.
- **Always** Before presenting a solution, double check that your response did not in fact remove code to simplify with comments. Restore the deleted code if that is the case.
- Try to prevent any linting errors from appearing in the first place.
- Do not decline variables that are not used. Instead, remove them. Do not define imports that are not used. Instead, remove them.
